## Customizing for Your Den's Rank Level

**The application comes pre-loaded with requirements for all Cub Scout ranks** with comprehensive pre-packaged requirements:

### Option 1: Use Pre-Packaged Requirements (Easiest)
1. Go to **Manage Requirements** ‚Üí **Import/Export** tab
2. Scroll to **"üì¶ Load Pre-Packaged Requirements"**
3. Select your rank from the dropdown:
   - Lion (Kindergarten) - *Detailed requirements*
   - Tiger (1st Grade) - *Detailed requirements*
   - Wolf (2nd Grade) - *Detailed requirements*
   - Bear (3rd Grade) - *Detailed requirements*
   - Webelos (4th Grade) - *Detailed requirements*
4. Click **"üì• Load [Rank] Requirements"** and confirm

**Note:** All ranks include detailed requirements that can be further customized after loading.

### Option 2: Use Default Lion Scout Requirements
- The app starts with Lion Scout requirements pre-loaded with full detail, making it ready to use immediately for Lion dens

### Option 3: Customize Requirements Manually
1. Use the **Add Requirement**, **Edit Requirement**, or **Delete Requirement** tabs to customize
2. Or start from scratch: Click "üóëÔ∏è Clear All Requirements" and add your own

### Option 4: Share Requirements Between Dens
1. One den leader exports their requirements (**Manage Requirements** ‚Üí **Import/Export** ‚Üí Download CSV)
2. Share the CSV file with other den leaders
3. Other leaders import the CSV (**Import/Export** ‚Üí Upload CSV)

### CSV Format for Requirements
```csv
Req_ID,Adventure,Requirement_Description,Required
Tiger.1,Tiger Circles,1. Gather the items...,True
Tiger.2,Tiger Circles,2. With your adult partner...,True
```

- **Req_ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., "Tiger.1", "Wolf.2")
- **Adventure**: Name of the adventure
- **Requirement_Description**: Full description of what scouts must do
- **Required**: `True` for required adventures, `False` for electives

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in CSV files in the `tracker_data/` directory:

- `Roster.csv`: Scout names
- `Requirement_Key.csv`: Scout requirements (fully editable through the app)
- `Meetings.csv`: Meeting details and requirements covered
- `Meeting_Attendance.csv`: Attendance records

## Default Requirements Structure (Lion Rank)

The application comes pre-loaded with official BSA Lion Scout requirements as the default:

### Required Adventures (Must complete all 6):
1. **Bobcat** (4 requirements)
2. **Fun on the Run** (4 requirements)
3. **Lion's Roar** (4 requirements)
4. **Lion's Pride** (3 requirements)
5. **King of the Jungle** (4 requirements)
6. **Mountain Lion** (4 requirements)

### Elective Adventures (Must complete any 2):
1. **Build It Up, Knock It Down** (3 requirements)
2. **Champions for Nature** (4 requirements)
3. **Count On Me** (3 requirements)
4. **Gizmos and Gadgets** (3 requirements)

You can add, edit, or remove requirements through the "Manage Requirements" page to customize for your den's needs.

## How It Works

The tracker automatically calculates which requirements each scout has completed by cross-referencing:
1. Which meetings each scout attended (from Meeting Attendance)
2. Which requirements were covered at each meeting (from Meetings)

This means you only need to:
1. Define your meetings once
2. Log attendance after each meeting
3. View the automatically updated progress dashboard

## Rank Completion Tracking

The tracker automatically calculates and displays when a scout has earned their rank based on the requirements loaded.

**Example: Lion Rank**
To earn the Lion rank, scouts must complete:
- All 6 required adventures (23 requirements total)
- Any 2 elective adventures (6-8 requirements depending on which electives)

Each rank has its own completion criteria which are tracked automatically in the dashboard and individual reports.

## Data Portability

All your data is stored in simple CSV files, which means you can:
- Back up your data by copying the `tracker_data/` folder
- Share your data with co-leaders
- Import/export to spreadsheet programs if needed
- Keep your data even if you stop using the application

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Data Layer**: Pandas with CSV storage
- **Architecture**: Single-page app with sidebar navigation

## Troubleshooting

**Data not saving?**
- Check that the application has write permissions in its directory

**Requirements don't show up?**
- Delete the `tracker_data/Requirement_Key.csv` file and restart the app to regenerate with defaults

**Need to reset everything?**
- Delete the entire `tracker_data/` directory and restart the app
