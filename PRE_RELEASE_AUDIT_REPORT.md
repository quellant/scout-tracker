# Pre-Release Security & Quality Audit Report
## Scout Tracker - Public Release Readiness

**Audit Date:** October 26, 2025
**Auditor:** Claude Code
**Repository:** scout-tracker
**Branch:** main

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES - MUST FIX BEFORE RELEASE

### 1. **PRIVACY VIOLATION: Real Scout Names in Screenshots/Videos**

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Risk:** Legal liability, privacy violation, COPPA compliance issues

**Issue:**
The `.playwright-mcp/` directory contains screenshots and videos with **real children's names**:
- Aiden Al-Zubaidi
- Alexander Garza
- Asher Arline
- Hendrix Tabor
- Katie Coop
- Luke Townsend
- Maggie Cheatham
- Nolan Reed
- Nova Jamison
- Remmy Current
- Stella Humphrey
- Tallula Geinosky
- Trip Beatty

**Files Affected:**
- 20 PNG screenshots
- 3 WebM video recordings (59MB total)

**Required Action:**
```bash
# Option 1: Remove all files (recommended)
git rm -r .playwright-mcp/
git commit -m "chore: remove screenshots with real scout data for privacy"

# Option 2: Replace with demo data
# 1. Delete tracker_data/
# 2. Re-run app with fake names (e.g., "Scout A", "Scout B", etc.)
# 3. Re-record screenshots
# 4. Replace files and commit
```

**Additional Step - Purge from Git History:**
```bash
# Remove from all commits (use BFG Repo Cleaner or git filter-repo)
git filter-repo --path .playwright-mcp/ --invert-paths
```

---

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES - Should Fix

### 2. **Documentation: Wrong Entry Point in README**

**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Users won't be able to run the application

**Issue:**
~~README.md says `streamlit run scout_tracker.py`~~ **FIXED**
Correct command is `streamlit run app.py`

**Status:** ✅ FIXED during audit

---

### 3. **Repository Size: Large Binary Files**

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Slow clones, wasted bandwidth

**Current Size:**
- .git directory: 43MB
- Mainly due to video files (43MB in .playwright-mcp/)

**Recommendation:**
- Remove videos from git history after privacy fix
- Add `.playwright-mcp/` to .gitignore
- Keep only 2-3 representative screenshots with fake data

---

### 4. **Test Artifacts Committed**

**Severity:** LOW
**Impact:** Repository cleanliness

**Files:**
- `.coverage` (binary coverage data)
- `coverage.xml` (XML report)

**Options:**
1. **Remove** - Standard practice for most repos
   ```bash
   git rm .coverage coverage.xml
   echo -e "\n# Test coverage\n.coverage\ncoverage.xml\n.pytest_cache/" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Keep** - If using for documentation/badges
   (Current approach - shows test quality to users)
